# SpeedHax
A competitive program for becoming a better creator. 

## Goalzzz ðŸ¤¯

The goal of this speed hackathon is to develop your skills at:
- Estimating time
- Developing scope 
- Problem solving velocity


## SetUp

Each team will have 30 minutes to develop the scope or deliverables of what they will accomplish in next hour and 30 minutes. This could be as simple as delivering research on a certain topic to developing the whole app.

Once the scope is delivered to the judges then teams will each have 1 hour and 30 minutes to finish their deliverables.

## Judging

Teams will be judged on how well they scoped project, their velocity, and total difficulty

A project that is scoped well and delivered completely but easy may beat a project that is not scoped well and delivered incomplete but was easy

## Past Results
